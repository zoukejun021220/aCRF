# Enhanced RAG System Final Status

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### 1. **Three Separate Indices**
- **Domain Index**: 63 SDTM domains with class, name, and definitions
- **Variable Index**: 1,917 variables with roles, labels, domains, and codelist references
- **CT Index**: 3,065 controlled terminology terms with definitions, synonyms, and NCI codes

### 2. **Hybrid Retrieval**
- **Dense Retrieval**: Using sentence-transformers models (BGE-small or BGE-M3)
- **Sparse Retrieval**: BM25 for exact matches and acronyms  
- **Hybrid Scoring**: Combines both approaches with configurable weights (alpha=0.7)

### 3. **Cross-Encoder Reranking (Optional)**
- Uses BAAI/bge-reranker-base for high-precision reranking
- Can be disabled for faster performance

### 4. **Intelligent Linking**
- Links variables to their domains
- Handles paired TEST/TESTCD relationships
- Applies role, format, and section bonuses in scoring

### 5. **Query Enrichment**
- Adds CT hints from options (Yes/No → NY codelist)
- Infers format hints (dates → Timing role)
- Includes section and form context

## 📊 Current Results

### Working Well ✅
1. **AESTDTC** correctly retrieved for "Date of adverse event onset" 
2. **CMTRT** found for "Concomitant medication name" (as candidate #3)
3. **All scores are positive** with the improved formula
4. **Retrieval is excellent** - target variables are in top results

### Issues to Address ⚠️
1. **Linking Logic**: BRTHDTC is retrieved #1 but not appearing in final results
2. **CT Linking**: Still showing 0.000 CT scores for all queries
3. **Missing Variable**: AEHOSP doesn't exist (but AESHOSP does)
4. **Ranking**: Some expected variables appear lower than they should

## 🛠️ Root Causes Identified

1. **Retrieval works perfectly** - The hybrid retriever finds the correct variables
2. **Linking/scoring phase has bugs** - Variables are getting filtered out or scored incorrectly
3. **Domain retrieval could be better** - Not always matching the right domain

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Test without reranker (faster, good results)
python test_rag_v2.py --model BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5

# Test with reranker (slower, potentially better)
python test_rag_v2.py --use-reranker --model BAAI/bge-m3
```

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Fix the linking logic** - Debug why top retrieved variables aren't making it to final results
2. **Implement CT linking** - Connect variables to their actual CT terms
3. **Add AEHOSP** to KB if needed, or use AESHOSP
4. **Fine-tune scoring weights** - Adjust the formula based on more test cases
5. **Add caching** for performance optimization

The enhanced RAG system provides a solid foundation with excellent retrieval capabilities. The main improvements needed are in the post-retrieval linking and scoring phases.
